Course Home Page: http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/classes/CS190_S16/index.html.

Due: Thursday, March 3rd, 2016.

## Directions for this Problem Set

* In the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/brianhill/intermediate-swift) study the two playgrounds numbered 4_1 and 4_2.

* The above two playgrounds follow _and_ _simplify_ _to_ _an_ _intermediate_ _level_, Sections 4.1 and 4.2 of [Advanced Swift](https://www.objc.io/books/advanced-swift/), by Chris Eidhof and Airspeed Velocity. Although the above two playground stand on their own, they could be used with Eidhof and Velocity in hand to take your understanding to an advanced level.
